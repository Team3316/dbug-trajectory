    This class is an implementation of a length integral for a 2d parameterized curve: [x(t), y(t)] between the
    points t0 and t1. It is known that the length from t0 to t (t0 <= t <= t1) is given using
        L(t) = integral(t0, t, sqrt(x'(z) ** 2 + y'(z) ** 2)dz)
    which is an integral between t0 to t. Therefore, we can use a Taylor expansion of order 3 around t0 to compute the
    integral easily and not using numerical integration methods. All of the numbering in this class start from one since
    the zero-th coefficient of the polynomial, L(t0), equals to 0. The coefficients can be obtained by differentiating
    the function n times, as per the definition of a Taylor polynomial.
